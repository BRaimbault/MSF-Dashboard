# How to contribute

If you want to give a hand but do not know where to start, get in touch with the [current contributors](https://github.com/MSF-UK/MSF-Dashboard/graphs/contributors), they will help you get started.

## Issue Submission Guidelines

* For bugs, feature requests and support questions submit a [github issue](https://github.com/MSF-UK/MSF-Dashboard/issues)
  * Please include the version of the MSF-Dashboard you are using
  * If you can, please try the latest version of MSF-Dashboard on the [master](https://github.com/MSF-UK/MSF-Dashboard/tree/master) branch to see if your issue has already been addressed or is otherwise affected by recent changes.
  * Please use labels for 'bugs' or 'questions', otherwise it is assumed to be an 'enhancement'. Difficulty labels are just indicator and try to facilitate contribution from less experienced developpers. Priority labels should be based on operational needs.
* It will be far, far easier for others to understand your problem or bug if you demonstrate it with a short example on http://jsfiddle.net/ or on http://bl.ocks.org/ (http://blockbuilder.org/ is a great way to edit bl.ocks!).

## Pull Request Guidelines

* As with all pull requests, put your changes in a branch. Please discuss contributions that change API.
* If you continue making changes to your fork of `MSF-Dashboard`, create a separate branch for each pull request and keep the changes separate.
